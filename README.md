# face-and-names
my test project for AI driven codes that is slightly more complex. No classic coding - english is the coding language (actually it is python)

# todo
- add code to check if the yolov11n-face.pt is loaded. if not load it at startup
- filter on face analysis on the images of the circles on top (month of image)
- add a filter to find images (person 1 and person 2 and not person 3)
